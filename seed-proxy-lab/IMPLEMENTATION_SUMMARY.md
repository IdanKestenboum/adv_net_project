# Implementation Summary - Student Version

## Overview

This document summarizes the student implementation version of the SEED Labs DDoS attack and mitigation lab. The lab has been modified to require students to complete several coding tasks to demonstrate their understanding of the concepts.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. HAProxy Configuration (`haproxy/haproxy.cfg`)

**Original Configuration**: Fully implemented with all protection mechanisms
**Student Version**: Contains TODO tasks for students to implement:

- **Task 1.1**: Define stick table for tracking abusive IPs
  - Students must implement: `stick-table type ip size 100k expire 10m store conn_rate(10s)`

- **Task 1.2**: Implement bypass path routing
  - Students must implement: ACL for bypass paths and routing logic

- **Task 1.3**: Implement IP tracking
  - Students must implement: `tcp-request connection track-sc0 src table abuse_tracker`

- **Task 1.4**: Define ACL for abusive IPs
  - Students must implement: `acl abusive_ip src_conn_rate(abuse_tracker) gt 20`

- **Task 1.5**: Implement routing logic
  - Students must implement: Conditional routing based on IP behavior

### 2. Attack Script (`attacker/slow_post_threads.py`)

**Original Script**: Fully implemented with all functionality
**Student Version**: Contains TODO tasks for students to implement:

- **Task 2.1**: Implement target host and port selection
  - Students must implement: Logic to set host and port based on target argument

- **Task 2.2**: Implement path selection
  - Students must implement: Logic to set path based on mode argument

- **Task 2.3**: Configure attack parameters
  - Students must implement: Set content_length and num_threads values

- **Task 2.4**: Implement socket connection
  - Students must implement: TCP socket creation and connection

- **Task 2.5**: Implement HTTP headers
  - Students must implement: HTTP header creation for POST request

- **Task 2.6**: Implement slow data transmission
  - Students must implement: Slow data sending logic

### 3. Documentation

**New Files Created**:
- `seed-manual.tex`: Student implementation manual with detailed task descriptions
- `README.md`: Comprehensive setup and testing instructions
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## Student Tasks Overview

### HAProxy Configuration Tasks (5 tasks)
1. **Stick Table Definition**: Students learn about HAProxy stick tables and their configuration
2. **Bypass Path Routing**: Students implement path-based routing using ACLs
3. **IP Tracking**: Students learn about connection tracking in HAProxy
4. **Abusive IP Detection**: Students implement rate-based abuse detection
5. **Routing Logic**: Students implement conditional routing based on client behavior

### Attack Script Tasks (6 tasks)
1. **Target Selection**: Students learn about command-line argument processing
2. **Path Selection**: Students implement conditional logic based on mode
3. **Parameter Configuration**: Students set appropriate attack parameters
4. **Socket Programming**: Students learn about TCP socket programming
5. **HTTP Protocol**: Students learn about HTTP header construction
6. **Slow Attack Implementation**: Students implement the core slow attack logic

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, students will:

1. **Understand HAProxy Configuration**:
   - Learn about stick tables and their configuration
   - Understand ACLs and their usage
   - Implement routing logic based on client behavior

2. **Understand Attack Mechanisms**:
   - Learn about slow HTTP attacks
   - Understand socket programming
   - Implement HTTP protocol headers

3. **Understand DDoS Protection**:
   - Learn about rate limiting and abuse detection
   - Understand traffic routing and load balancing
   - Implement protection mechanisms

## Evaluation Criteria

### Implementation Tasks (60%)
- **HAProxy Configuration (30%)**: Correct implementation of stick tables, ACLs, and routing logic
- **Attack Script (30%)**: Correct implementation of target selection, path selection, and attack logic

### Testing and Validation (40%)
- **Configuration Validation (20%)**: HAProxy configuration compiles and runs without errors
- **Attack Effectiveness (20%)**: Attack script successfully demonstrates DDoS and protection mechanisms

## Testing Instructions

1. **Verify HAProxy Configuration**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it haproxy haproxy -c -f /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
   ```

2. **Test Attack Script**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it attacker bash
   python3 slow_post_threads.py proxy protected
   ```

3. **Verify Protection**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it user sh
   curl -s http://haproxy:8081/
   ```

## Expected Outcomes

After completing all tasks, students should be able to:

1. **Successfully compile and run HAProxy** with their implemented configuration
2. **Execute the attack script** and observe DDoS behavior
3. **Verify protection mechanisms** are working correctly
4. **Understand the relationship** between attack and defense mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

Common issues students may encounter:

1. **HAProxy configuration errors**: Check syntax and ensure all TODO tasks are completed
2. **Attack script errors**: Verify Python syntax and ensure all variables are defined
3. **Container connectivity issues**: Ensure all containers are running and on the same network
4. **Permission issues**: Check file permissions and Docker access
